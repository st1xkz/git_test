        <p>We're turning s'mores into the perfect Father's Day-inspired dessert. Your father will associate this pie with so many things men love: building fires, carving pointy sticks, scaring things, and so forth. This has the classic three layers of the s'more: the graham crackers, chocolate, and toasted marshmallows.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups finely crushed graham cracker crumbs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) package chocolate ice cream, slightly softened</li>
            <li>2 cups miniature marshmallows, or enough to cover the top</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place graham cracker crumbs into a bowl, add sugar and melted butter, and mix until well combined. Transfer mixture into a 9-inch pie dish. Gently press graham cracker mixture into the bottom and up the sides of the pie dish using a spatula. Pat the edge and inside of the crust smooth with your fingers.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate crust until thoroughly chilled, at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Fill crust with chocolate ice cream using a small ice cream scoop. Smooth the ice cream with a spatula. Place a ring of mini marshmallows around the inside of the crust and cover top of ice cream with remaining marshmallows. Gently press marshmallows into the ice cream.</li>
            <li>Freeze until very firm, at least 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Use a propane torch to toast the marshmallows, moving the torch quickly to brown the marshmallows. Marshmallows should have small charred spots. Return to freezer to chill the marshmallow topping, at least 3 hours; slice and serve.</li>
        </ol>
